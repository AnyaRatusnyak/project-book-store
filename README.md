This is an application for online book store . 
An Online Bookstore API is a back-end part of virtual store  where customers can browse the catalog and select books of interest. User can select many books and those books stored in cart. At checkout time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order.
Admins can manage this online bookstore.  This application serves as the core infrastructure , delivering crucial functionalities for book management, user authentication, and order processing.

 ### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies and Tools Used
- Spring Boot: For building the application framework.
- Spring Security: To handle authentication and authorization.
- Spring Data JPA: For database interactions using JPA.
- Spring Web: For building web-based applications with Spring MVC.
- Swagger: For API documentation and testing.
- Hibernate: As the ORM tool.
- MySQL: For the relational database.
- Liquibase: For database schema versioning and management.
- Docker: For containerizing the application.
- Maven: For project management and dependency management.
### üöÄ Current Functionalities
- ##### Authentication 
  - Register a new user: POST /api/auth/register
    - Example of request body:
      ```
      {
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "password": "securePassword123",
      "repeatPassword": "securePassword123",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "shippingAddress": "123 Main St, City, Country"
      }
      ```
    - Example of response body:
      ```
      {
      "id": 1,
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe",
      "shippingAddress": "123 Main St, City, Country"
      }
      ```
  - Authenticate a user: POST /api/auth/login   
  
    The Online Bookstore API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) for securing API endpoints. JWTs are issued to users upon successful authentication and must be included in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to protected endpoints.After a user successfully logs in, the server issues a JWT. This token must be included in the Authorization header of subsequent requests to protected endpoints.
    - Example of request body:
      ```
      {
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "password": "securePassword123",
      }
      ```
    - Example of response body:
      ```
      {
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0yfQ.SflKssw5c"
      }
      ```
